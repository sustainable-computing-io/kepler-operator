# kepler-operator

Kepler Operator installs Kepler and all required manifests on Kubernetes/OpenShift

## Description
Kepler (Kubernetes-based Efficient Power Level Exporter) is a Prometheus exporter. It uses eBPF to probe CPU performance counters and Linux kernel tracepoints.

These data and stats from cgroup and sysfs can then be fed into ML models to estimate energy consumption by Pods.

Check out the project on GitHub ➡️ [Kepler](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/kepler).

## Getting Started
You’ll need a Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) or microshift to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### To run a kind cluster locally 

```sh
make cluster-up
```

### To run a microshift cluster locally

```sh
make cluster-up CLUSTER_PROVIDER=microshift
```

### Run kepler-operator locally out of cluster

```sh
make tools
make run
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

### Run using pre-published image

You can use the image from [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/sustainable_computing_io/kepler-operator?tab=tags) to deploy kepler-operator. 

```sh
make deploy OPERATOR_IMG=quay.io/sustainable_computing_io/kepler-operator:latest
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

Alternatively, if you like to build and use your own image,
	
```sh
make operator-build operator-push IMG_BASE=<some-registry>
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kepler-operator:tag
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

### Uninstall the operator

```sh
# NOTE: default version is 0.5.0
./hack/uninstall-operator.sh [version]

```

### Automated development environment

If don't have a `go` development environment, or you just want a reproducible environment to start fresh, you can use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), and the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension to bring up an environment with `go`, `docker`, `kind`, `kubectl`, `kustomize`, and `oc`. To activate this, open the project from the command line with `code .` and then press the **Reopen in Container** button when prompted. (See the [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) documentation for more details).
