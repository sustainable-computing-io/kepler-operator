If you are good with our [License](./LICENSE) and [DCO](./DCO), follow these steps to start with your 1st code contribution:

1. Fork & clone Kepler Operator

## Local Development Environment

TO-DO

## Testing

### CI Tests

The Kepler-Operator CI tests perform the following checks:

- [integration tests](./.github/workflows/integration_test.yml)

### Unit Tests

We run Go tests based on specific build tags for different conditions.
Please don't break other build tags, otherwise CI may fail.

To run the unit tests:

```sh
make test
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests should be based on the minimal scope of a unit test needed to succeed.

The GitHub Actions workflow for integration tests and in-depth steps can be found [here](./.github/workflows/integration_test.yml).

## Sign Commits

Please sign and commit your changes with `git commit -s`. More information on how to sign commits can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).

## Commit Messages

Please refer to the Kubernetes commit message guidelines that can be found [here](https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/pull-requests/#commit-message-guidelines).

We have 3 rules as commit messages check to ensure a commit message is meaningful:

- Try to keep the subject line to 50 characters or less; do not exceed 72 characters
- Providing additional context with the following formatting: `<topic>: <something>`
- The first word in the commit message subject should be capitalized unless it starts with a lowercase symbol or other identifier

For example:

```sh
Doc: update Developer.md
```
